# Ist die machBar offen?

`Ist die machBar offen?` is a simple client-side JavaScript front end, which queries the
space-api of the CCC-P (`https://spaceapi.ccc-p.org`) and displays whether the hackerspace ("machBar") is open or closed.
The `state.open` field returned by the space-api is controlled by the IoT enabled ["SpaceSchalter"](https://github.com/Chaostreff-Potsdam/SpaceSchalter) which is located inside the hackerspace.
